FACT OF THE DAY: Camp Sundown in Craryville, NY is a summer camp specifically for children afflicted with xeroderma pigmentosum, an exceptionally rare condition that makes them unable to bear sunlight. About 20 campers per year spend their days in a light-insulated building and their nights at swimming pools, mini-golf courses, and other traditional daytime activities.
